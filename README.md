This project is an android app that has been designed to monitore visible chemical rezctions in which reactives color is different to products'.

The app works through a phone camera, which monitores the reaction getting relative light intensities measures. Those are later converted to concentration measures to get the speed formula and function of the reaction.

Its first version is not finished yet so there's no license of any kind to use this project yet.
